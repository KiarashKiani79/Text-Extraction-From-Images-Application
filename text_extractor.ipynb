    "#### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)\n",
    "This project focuses on extracting structured text from images and enhancing it using OpenCV for more accurate results. The process involves downloading and installing Tesseract and other dependencies, loading the desired image, and using Tesseract to extract the text. The extracted text is then processed, especially for complex images, using OpenCV. Image processing operations include noise removal, threshold transformation, erosion, and drawing rectangles around specific patterns or characters. This automated Optical Character Recognition (OCR) method can be used by organizations to extract useful information from images and by individuals to save time and effort in typing. It eases the burden of document analysis and understanding. Let's get started with the project.\n"
